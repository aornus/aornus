# The Human Seasons

### ——By John Keats

Four Seasons fill the measure of the year;

   There are four seasons in the mind of man:

He has his lusty Spring, when fancy clear

   Takes in all beauty with an easy span:

He has his Summer, when luxuriously

   Spring's honied cud of youthful thought he loves

To ruminate, and by such dreaming high

   Is nearest unto heaven: quiet coves

His soul has in its Autumn, when his wings

   He furleth close; contented so to look

On mists in idleness—to let fair things

   Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook.

He has his Winter too of pale misfeature,

Or else he would forego his mortal nature.

# 人生的四季

###  --济慈

四季轮回构成了一年， 

​	人的心灵也有四季更替： 

他有生机勃勃的春天， 

​	在幻想中把所有美景一览无余； 

在那奢华繁盛的夏天，

​	 他爱把春天采集的花蜜细细品尝，

 沉浸在甜美的青春思绪中， 

​	他高高飞扬的梦想几乎升上天堂； 

秋天他的心灵栖息在宁静的港湾， 

​	他收拢了疲倦的羽翼， 

休闲而满足地透过雾气遥望，

​	 任美好的事物像门前的小溪不经意地流逝。 

他终将走进冬天的苍凉晚景，

​	 不然他就失去了凡人的本性。
